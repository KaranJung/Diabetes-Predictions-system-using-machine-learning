Diabetes Predictions system using machine learning


Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prevention of diabetes is crucial for managing the disease and reducing the risk of complications. In this project, we will explore how machine learning can be used to predict the onset of diabetes based on various risk factors.
